# Chatbot-prac

This project acts as an introduction to Machine Learning. A lot of people tend to misunderstand the concept but with a few examples hopefully you'll be able to learn something new.

Before we start, make sure that you have a working environment and that you're using Visual Studio.
Create a python file (you may come with any name you like). On my GitHub server you should find a file called my_app.py, copy the code an paste it in your new python file

Create a text file, this is where you'll store data whhich will be retrieved by the NLP. Copy the code on my text file (machine.txt) on GitHub and paste it on your new text file. You should also find a requirements file which contains modules which you'll need to execute the code.

Now this ChatBot is very basic and can only answer three :
                                           "what is machine learning\n"
                                           "how to implement machine learning\n"
                                           "differences between machine learning and neural networks"
If a user goes beyond this scope they will encounter an error management code (basicaly a reply that the system doesn't have enough information on athat topic)
